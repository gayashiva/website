abstract: Since 2014, mountain communities in Ladakh, India have been constructing
  dozens of Artificial Ice Reservoirs (AIRs) by spraying water through fountain systems
  every winter. The meltwater from these structures is crucial to meet irrigation
  water demands during spring. However, there is a large variability associated with
  this water supply due to the local weather influences at the chosen location. This
  study compared the ice volume evolution of an AIR built in Ladakh, India with two
  others built in Guttannen, Switzerland using a surface energy balance model. Model
  input consisted of meteorological data in conjunction with fountain discharge rate
  (mass input of an AIR). Model calibration and validation were completed using ice
  volume and surface area measurements taken from several drone surveys. The model
  was successful in estimating the observed ice volume evolution with a root mean
  square error within 18% of the maximum ice volume for all the AIRs. The location
  in Ladakh had a maximum ice volume four times larger compared to the Guttannen site.
  However, the corresponding water losses for all the AIRs were more than three-quarters
  of the total fountain discharge due to high fountain wastewater. Drier and colder
  locations in relatively cloud-free regions are expected to produce long-lasting
  AIRs with higher maximum ice volumes. This is a promising result for dry mountain
  regions, where AIR technology could provide a relatively affordable and sustainable
  strategy to mitigate climate change induced water stress.
