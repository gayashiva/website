  ABSTRACT = {Since 2014, mountain communities in Ladakh, India have been
              constructing dozens of Artificial Ice Reservoirs (AIRs) by spraying
              water through fountain systems every winter. The meltwater from
              these structures is crucial to meet irrigation water demands during
              spring. However, there is a large variability associated with this
              water supply due to the local weather influences at the chosen
              location. This study compared the ice volume evolution of an AIR
              built in Ladakh, India with two others built in Guttannen,
              Switzerland using a surface energy balance model. Model input
              consisted of meteorological data in conjunction with fountain
              discharge rate (mass input of an AIR). Model calibration and
              validation were completed using ice volume and surface area
              measurements taken from several drone surveys. The model was
              successful in estimating the observed ice volume evolution with a
              root mean square error within 18% of the maximum ice volume for all
              the AIRs. The location in Ladakh had a maximum ice volume four
              times larger compared to the Guttannen site. However, the
              corresponding water losses for all the AIRs were more than
              three-quarters of the total fountain discharge due to high fountain
              wastewater. Drier and colder locations in relatively cloud-free
              regions are expected to produce long-lasting AIRs with higher
              maximum ice volumes. This is a promising result for dry mountain
              regions, where AIR technology could provide a relatively affordable
              and sustainable strategy to mitigate climate change induced water
              stress.},
