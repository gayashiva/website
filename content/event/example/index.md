abstract: "Since 2014, mountain communities in Ladakh, India have been constructing dozens of Artificial Ice
Reservoirs (AIRs) by spraying water through fountain systems every winter. The meltwater from these structures
is crucial to meet irrigation water demands during spring. However, there is a large variability associated with
this water supply due to the local weather influences at the chosen location. This study compared the ice volume
evolution of an AIR built in Ladakh, India with two others built in Guttannen, Switzerland using a surface
energy balance model. Model input consisted of meteorological data in conjunction with fountain discharge rate
(mass input of an AIR). Validation with droneâ€™s ice volume observations shows the model performs well. Our
results show that the conical shape of AIRs significantly reduce solar radiation-induced melt. The location in
Ladakh had a maximum ice volume four times larger compared to the Guttannen site. However, the corresponding
water losses for all the AIRs were more than three-quarters of the total fountain discharge due to high fountain
wastewater. Drier and colder locations in relatively cloud-free regions are expected to produce long-lasting
AIRs with higher maximum ice volumes. This is a promising result for dry mountain regions, where AIR technology
could provide a relatively affordable and sustainable strategy to mitigate climate change induced water stress."
